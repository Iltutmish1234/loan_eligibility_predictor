# loan_eligibility_predictor
🏦 <b>Loan Eligibility Predictor : </b>
<br>A machine learning project that predicts loan eligibility based on applicant details. This project uses Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier for classification, and includes data visualizations like countplot to explore feature distributions.

📌<b> Project Overview :</b>
<br>Loan providers often need quick and accurate systems to determine if an applicant is eligible for a loan. This project applies supervised machine learning algorithms to automate the process, ensuring speed and accuracy in loan approval prediction.

🔍 <b>Features :</b>
<br>Exploratory Data Analysis using Seaborn's countplot<br>
Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding categorical variables<br>

<b>Model building using :</b>
<br>Logistic Regression<br>
Random Forest Classifier<br>

<b>Model evaluation using :</b>

Classification Report<br>
Prediction based on user input data.

📊 <b>Technologies Used :</b>
<br>Python<br>
Pandas, NumPy<br>
Seaborn, Matplotlib (for visualizations)<br>
Scikit-learn (for ML models)<br>
Jupyter Notebook

📁 <b>Dataset :</b>
<br>The dataset contains applicant information such as:<br>
Gender, Married, Dependents<br>
Education, Self_Employed<br>
ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome<br>
LoanAmount, Credit_History<br>
Property_Area<br>

<b>Target Variable : </b>
<br>Loan_Status

✅ <b>Conclusion :</b>
The model helps predict whether a loan should be approved based on applicant details. Random Forest generally gives better results for this classification problem due to its ensemble nature.
